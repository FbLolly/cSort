cSort
-

//description//
cSort is a program that simulates sorting algorithms using raylib, the code is in C.

//Problems-Bugs//
if the DIVIDER value is set very small (close to 2) then the sorting algorithms start to run very slowly and there is currently
no way of raising the FPS over a certain limit in raylib.

//how to open the project//
cSort is currently only compiled for GNU/linux but it should be compatible with windows too if compiled there.

//how to use the program//
cSorts GUI is pretty straight forward but here are some things I wanted to specify:

--- in the menu you can either choose a sorting algorithm to watch or go into the settings where you can change the DIVIDER value using a slider
    (the bigger the DEVIDER value is the smaller the arrays will be)

--- in the actual sorting algorithm demo you can pause with SPACE or by pressing the pause and play button and you can raise or lower the FPS using the left and right arrows
    or by clicking the proper buttons. It is also possible to move the mouse to the right and hold left click to make a demo of the sorting code appear.
    You can now also click on an element of the array to make its value appear bigger.
