cSort
-

//description//
A small C project made by a random 11th grader that uses raylib as its graphics library
The program shows various the graphical interpretation of various sorting algorithms

//Problems//
Unfortunately the fullscreen mode still does not work really well and i hope to fix it in the future.

The DEVIDER variable is widely used in the whole program so i though it would be a waste to pass it to almost
all the functions in the program, and even tho i know it is unsafe i decided made it a grobal variable.

//how to open the project//
The project is currently only built and compiled for GNU/Linux, in the future i will be releasing a compiled version for windows (.exe) too.

//how to use the program//
Once the program is open you will be faced with a menu screen that makes you choose between 10 sorting algorithms (more will be added in the future),
opening the settings window (for now only a slider to set the devider value) and quitting the program.
Once you choose a sorting algorithm an array will get randomized with random values and it will also start to get sorted by the algorithm
you choose.

While the array is getting sorted you can move your cursor to the right of the screen and hold left click to make a window with the
explanatory code of the choosen sorting algorithm, 

(With keyboard)
You can press space to temporarily stop the execution of the algorithm and press it again to
rewind the algorithm, you can also press the left and right arrow keys to make the algorithm go faster or slower.

(With mouse)
You can move your cursort to the top bar of the program to choose between a pause and rewind button, a left arrow button and a right arrow one which have respectively the same functions as the
space, left arrow and right arrow keys
